# Point and Text Adventure game.
Making myself a little web game, inspired by Ludum Dare 41.

The theme was to combine 2 incompatible genres. My first idea is an old **texted based adventure game** that uses the graphical interactions of the less-old **point and click adventure games**. All story telling would be through text. All player interactions would use iconographic cursors to click on words within the story. Thus representing an action performed on an object, or a verb paired with a noun, as in old text games. "get lamp"

Unfortunately, I never submitted the game to ldjam.com, as I really only got involved the last day. Still though, in the spirit of the event, I am making something, *anything*. Putting it out there and continuing to work on it.

As of this writing, I still have quite a bit to do. It's currently more of a "tech demo" or "minimum viable product". The game presents an interface with some buttons, cursors, text feed, and a couple objects to "look" at.

Next steps will include:
implement a set of game state variables.
differentiating the action taken on click.
refactoring the code a bit.
and a whole lot of story writing.
